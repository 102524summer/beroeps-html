        <!-- Character Bill -->
        <div class="character" onclick= <img src="images/Ellis.png">
            <img src="images/Bill.jpg" alt="Bill">
            <div class="character-name">Bill</div>
            <p>Bill is the oldest survivor of Left 4 Dead. Bill fought in active combat during the Vietnam War with the Green Berets.

                Bill is the oldest, theorized to be in his 60s due to his involvement in Vietnam, of the original Survivor team and appears to hold a strong presence as the group leader. He also appears to show some previous experience of fighting the Infected as he is able to recognize a Witch immediately on sight in the opening cutscene and he is also able to infer that the Infected are mutating into Special Infected simply by examining goo left on the ground.</p>

        <!-- Character Coach -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Coach')">
            <img src="images/Coach.png" alt="coach">
            <div class="character-name">Coach</div>
           <p> oach is one of four playable Survivors in Left 4 Dead 2. He's the eldest of the Survivors, with his experience as a high school football coach giving him authority. (Much like Bill in Left 4 Dead) Though, he retains a very optimistic attitude. His face model is Darnell Rice and his voice actor is Chad Coleman.
 
            A native of Savannah, Georgia, where the beginning of the game takes place, Coach was a defensive lineman in college. However, a knee injury ended his career, and he went back to his hometown to teach health at his local high school and coach his local high school football team (as a defensive coordinator) until the infection spread to his town.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Ellis -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Ellis')">
            <img src="images/Ellis.png" alt="Ellis">
            <div class="character-name">Ellis</div>
            <p> ontrasting with the gloom outlook of the zombified South and comments from fellow survivor Nick, Ellis plays mostly as the game's comic relief. Along with his attitude and thick Southern dialect, Ellis occasionally lightens the mood with humorous stories about his misadventures with friends before the outbreak until he is interrupted by an irritated survivor.

                A recurring character in these stories is a friend named Keith who has a tendency to get himself hurt in a variety of humorous, blue-collar ways such as trying to deep-fry a turkey, getting run over by a riding mower, and being assaulted by a Klansman.
                
                Keith is never seen in-game, and it is not certain if he had survived the epidemic.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Francis -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Francis')">
            <img src="images/Francis.jpg" alt="Francis">
            <div class="character-name">Francis</div>
            <p>Cocky, loud, and pretty sure he's indestructible, Francis acts like the zombie apocalypse is the world's biggest bar fight. When the virus hit, everybody else stockpiled food and looked for a place to hide. Francis found a gun and had some fun. No cops, no laws, no orderâ€”if it wasn't for all the zombies, he could almost get used to life like this.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Louis -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Louis')">
            <img src="images/Louis.jpg" alt="Louis">
            <div class="character-name">Louis</div>
            <p>Louis had been working up the courage to quit his job as Junior Systems Analyst at his company's IT department when a virus showed up and downsized the world. Now Louis has a new set of goals (live long enough to succeed) and a new set of tools (guns, sharp objects) to help him achieve them. With any luck, he'll figure out how the new management operates before they get a chance to murder him</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Nick -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Nick')">
            <img src="images/Nick.png" alt="Nick">
            <div class="character-name">Nick</div>
           <p>Gambler, con-man, Nick only trust himself and is often very aggresive with the other survivors especialy towards Ellis. altough he does bear a soft spot for the survivors towards the end.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Rochelle -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Rochelle')">
            <img src="images/Rochelle.png" alt="Rochelle">
            <div class="character-name">Rochelle</div>
            <p>Rochelle seems to take on a motherly role for the group, and is constantly on the look out for the well being of all of the survivors, generally being kind to everyone. 
                Rochelle was a low-level associate producer working for a big news company, altough When people started calling in sick, however, she realized that the zombie outbreak could provide her with the perfect breakout role as a news reporter. Having managed to escape the first wave, she soon met up with fellow survivors Ellis, Coach and Nick. She then decides that she'll get her story out, even if it's the last thing she'll do</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Character Zoey -->
        <div class="character" onclick="selectCharacter('Zoey')">
            <img src="images/Zoey.jpg" alt="Zoey">
            <div class="character-name">Zoey</div>
            <p> at the time the infection broke out, Zoey's parents were divorced, her mother was remarried, and Zoey was living with her father, a cop. Zoey's father taught her how to shoot a gun. She seems to have been closer to her father, sneaking out and watching zombie movies with him. She had a college scholarship and was supposed to be studying making movies, but was spending her time watching zombie and vampire movies, instead. During an argument with her parents at the dinner table, a "homeless man" bit her mother, Lynne, and Lynne in turn bit Zoey's father. Zoey's father, fearing he'd "turn" like in the zombie movies they'd seen, asked Zoey to shoot him. Apparently Zoey gets her resistance to the infection from her father's side. Bill appears to treat Zoey like a surrogate daughter.

                Zoey also apparently has a huge weakness for peanut butter.</p>
